## LinkedIn Safety Guidelines

### Daily/Weekly Limits

| Action | New Account | Established Account | Maximum |
|--------|-------------|--------------------| --------|
| Connection Requests | 15-20/day | 40-60/day | 100/week |
| Messages | 50/day | 100-150/day | 150/day |
| Profile Views | 50/day | 80/day | 80/day (free) |
| InMails | Based on plan | Based on plan | 50-150/mo |

### Account Warm-Up Schedule

| Period | Actions/Day | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 10-15 | Very conservative start |
| Weeks 2-3 | 20-30 | Gradual increase |
| Month 2 | 40-50 | Monitor acceptance rates |
| Month 3+ | Up to 100 | Stay below maximum |

### Behavior Patterns to Follow

- Spread actions over 10-12 hour periods
- Avoid targeting same company repeatedly
- Use random delays between actions
- Don't run manual + automated simultaneously
- Vary message content (no copy-paste at scale)

### Warning Signs of Detection

- "You're visiting too many profiles" messages
- Frequent CAPTCHA challenges
- Email/phone verification prompts
- Declining connection acceptance rates
- Temporary feature restrictions

### If Restricted

1. **Stop all automation immediately** (minimum 1 week)
2. Don't create new accounts (same IP = permanent ban)
3. Wait for restriction period to pass
4. Appeal through official LinkedIn process (don't mention automation)
5. Warm up account gradually when returning

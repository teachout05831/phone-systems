| Accurate Sender Info | "From" name and email must be accurate, not misleading |
| Honor Opt-Outs | Process opt-out requests within 10 business days |

### Penalties

## GDPR (European Union)

### Requirements
| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Legitimate Interest | Must have valid legal basis (legitimate interest for B2B cold outreach) |
| Document Data Sources | Know and record where you got contact data |
| Easy Opt-Out | Simple way to unsubscribe/opt-out |
| Data Minimization | Only collect/store data you need |
| Right to Access | Recipients can request their data |
| Right to Deletion | Must delete data upon request |

### Penalties

### Notes for B2B Cold Email
- "Legitimate interest" allows B2B outreach WITHOUT explicit consent
- You're contacting them because their business could benefit
- Still must offer easy opt-out and honor requests
- Keep separate lists for EU vs non-EU contacts
- Document your legitimate interest reasoning

## Cold Calling Compliance

### Do Not Call (DNC) Registry
- Check numbers against National DNC Registry
- Maintain internal DNC list of people who've asked not to be called
- B2B calls to business numbers are generally exempt from DNC
- But calling personal cell phones of business owners = check DNC

### TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)
- No auto-dialers to cell phones without consent
- No pre-recorded messages to cell phones without consent
- Honor do-not-call requests
- Calling hours: 8am - 9pm recipient's local time

### State-Specific Laws
Some states have additional restrictions. Key ones:
- California (CCPA) - additional privacy requirements
- Florida - stricter calling restrictions
- Various states - registration requirements for telemarketing

## LinkedIn / Social Compliance

### LinkedIn Terms of Service
- No automation tools that violate LinkedIn TOS
- No scraping of LinkedIn data
- Connection limits enforced by LinkedIn
- Risk of account restriction/ban

### Risk Mitigation
- Use tools that operate "safely" within LinkedIn limits
- Warm up accounts slowly

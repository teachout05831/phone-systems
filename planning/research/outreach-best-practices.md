## Follow-Up Sequence

**Key Stat: 60% of replies come after the first follow-up!**

### Recommended Sequence

| Email # | Timing | Purpose | Approach |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Day 1 | Initial outreach | Introduce value proposition |
| 2 | Days 3-4 | Quick reminder | Short, bump previous email |
| 3 | Days 7-10 | New angle | Different value prop or insight |
| 4 | Days 14-17 | Social proof | Case study or testimonial |
| 5 | Days 21-30 | Breakup email | Create urgency, last chance |

### Follow-Up Email Tips
- Keep follow-ups shorter than initial email
- Reference previous email ("Wanted to follow up on...")
- Add new value or angle each time
- Breakup email often gets highest response rate
- Don't be needy - provide value

### Sample Follow-Up Framework

**Email 2 (Day 3-4):**
> Just wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox. Did you get a chance to look at [previous topic]?

**Email 3 (Day 7-10):**
> I was thinking about [their specific situation] and wanted to share [new insight/resource/angle].

**Email 4 (Day 14-17):**
> [Company similar to them] was in a similar situation and [specific result they got]. Thought you might find this relevant.

**Email 5 (Day 21-30):**
> I don't want to keep filling up your inbox, so this will be my last email. If [problem you solve] isn't a priority right now, totally understand. If it becomes one, here's how to reach me: [contact].

## Multi-Channel Strategy

### Channel Combination Results
| Strategy | Response Lift |
|----------|---------------|
| Email only | Baseline |
| Email + LinkedIn | +50% response |
| Email + LinkedIn + Call | +287% engagement |
| Email + Retargeting Ads | +25% conversion |

### Multi-Channel Sequence Example
```
Day 1: Email - Initial outreach
Day 2: LinkedIn - View profile
Day 3: LinkedIn - Connect request
Day 5: Email - Follow-up #1
Day 7: LinkedIn - Message (if connected)
Day 10: Email - Follow-up #2 (new angle)
Day 14: Call - If no response
Day 17: Email - Social proof
Day 21: Final email + LinkedIn message
```

### Channel-Specific Tips

**LinkedIn:**
- Warm up by engaging with their content first
- Keep connection requests short (< 300 chars)
- Personalize based on profile/content
- Don't pitch in connection request

**Cold Calling:**
- Best after email opens/engagement
- Morning calls (9-11 AM) often better
- Have a script but sound natural
- Voicemail should be < 30 seconds

## Personalization Strategies

### Levels of Personalization
| Level | Effort | Impact | Example |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| None | Low | Low | Mass email template |
| Basic | Medium | Medium | {{first_name}}, {{company}} merge |
| Research-based | High | High | Reference their content/news |
| Video/Custom | Very High | Very High | Personalized Loom video |

### Quick Personalization Ideas
- Reference recent company news
- Mention mutual connection
- Comment on their LinkedIn post
- Reference their content/podcast/video
- Note their company's specific challenge
- Mention their tech stack

### Personalization That Works
**Good:** "Saw your recent post about [topic] - great point about [specific detail]. Made me think..."

**Bad:** "Hi {{first_name}}, I hope this email finds you well..."

## Message Templates Framework

### The AIDA Formula
- **A**ttention: Hook them with relevance to THEM
- **I**nterest: Show you understand their problem
- **D**esire: Present your solution/value
- **A**ction: Clear, simple CTA

### Cold Email Framework
```
Line 1: Personalized hook (about them)
Line 2-3: Problem you solve / why you're reaching out
Line 4: What you offer (brief)
Line 5: CTA (question, not ask)
```

### Example Structure
> [Personalization - something about them or their company]
>
> I noticed [observation about their situation].
>
> We help [who] do [what] so they can [benefit].
>
> Would it make sense to chat about [specific topic]?

## Testing & Optimization

### What to A/B Test
| Element | Priority | Impact Potential |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Subject line | High | Highest |
| Opening line | High | High |
| CTA | Medium | Medium |
| Send time | Medium | Medium |
| Email length | Low | Low |

### Minimum Test Size
- Need at least 100-200 recipients per variant

- Track reply rate, not just open rate
